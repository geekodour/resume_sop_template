Ever since I was a child, my favorite thing to do was to relate one thing to another and organise them. As I grew up, this childhood pastime led to a blossoming interest in computer networking. I was fascinated by how two computers could talk over the wire. 

Eventually, I was introduced to the web and existing social media and was captivated by the realisation that we are surrounded by so many networks. This sudden awareness turned my growing interest into a fully fledged passion which led me to pursue a better understanding of computer networks and network programming.

\vspace{2mm}

During the first year of my undergraduate studies I discovered that I can extract required data from the internet and create my own version of the data with just a few lines of code, moreover I was able to plot and visualize that data.
I was intrigued by the magnitude of what could be done and I relentlessly worked on networks involving various webpages and social media platforms.
I am now capable of applying the database, data structures and algorithm concepts that I acquired in the last two years when dealing with
extraction of information. Along the way I was able to pickup applications of NLP and apply them when processing extracted information.

\vspace{2mm}
In recent times, I developed an inclination towards Web Information Extraction and building social media tools.
To be more specific, I am interested in how the is-a relation can be determined out of the structured information
extracted from an unstructured webpage. Furthermore, I am interested in how we can study social media networks and generate new information and applications through social media data.

\statement{Why Precog? :}
In my opinion, having a deep understanding of one computer science field with a fair amount of knowledge of the other fields
really helps build better solutions and building several social media tools and web crawlers
recently has piqued my interest in understanding how these networks work and how we can make better application by making use
of social media data. I have always been looking for the next step of improvement and I am certain that Precog@IIITD will 
abundantly satisfy my need to study social media networks in depth hence apply data extraction to get meaningful results.
Moreover Precog lab is about building solutions for social good which I really want to be a part of. 
I feel that an internship at Precog will be a major step towards achieving my goals.

\statement{My Background :}
I am persuing my graduation from GIMT Guwahati and my interest in computers science dates back to my school days.
During these years, I absorbed a fair amount of exposure to the various fields of computer science. 
I have a strong grasp of the topics that I have learnt until now and have an ardent desire to learn and explore new avenues in computer science.
I have also developed an interest in networks and text mining along with systems and network programming.
I have always been more involved in the implementation aspect of the development process, however there still persists a breach between me and a proper understanding of the theoretical research work that is required and would therefore love to fill the gap as much as possible. I would also like to add that working with information extraction and social media will give me an opportunity to get more deeply involved in an area I am vehemently passionate about.

\statement{How Precog will help me :}
My academic record has been consistently average throughout school as well as now but I have always been enraptured by the field of networks and text mining and Precog encapsulates everything that intensifies my desire to learn.  
I would regard my acceptance in Precog@IIITD as a great honour as well as a challenge to prove my worth to myself.
